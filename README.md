# H | 2 | knOw

Know exactly when to water your plants and become the best plant parent with this visual schedule. 

## Getting Started

The following instructions will provide a copy of H|2|knOw and ready it for launch on a local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

Run

```
npm install

```
```
npm start

```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on a browser to view H|2|knOw.

### Additional Features Coming Soon!

To make this application even more awesome, I would like to add an "Add A Plant" feature. Users would be able to add new plants to the schedule and continue to see their plant family grow! Additionally, I would create "Edit A Plant" and "Remove A Plant" features so users can view the most accurate information. In order to incorporate the full functionality of a CRUD application, I will build out the backend with a relational database, as the data is currently hardcoded. <br />

Currently, Fullcalendar.io does not support the creation of bi-weekly events. In order to implement bi-weekly events into this application, I had to hardcode multiple same events with different dates. I am aware that this is not efficient and will spend more time determining a better way of scheduling events in the application. This will mostly likely be accounted for in my models/backend. <br />

Lastly, I am working on deploying the application with Heroku. 

### Known Issues

Currently, there aren't any known issues with this application. However, if a bug is found, please notify the author.
