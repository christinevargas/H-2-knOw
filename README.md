# H | 2 | knOw

Know exactly when to water your plants and become the best plant parent.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will provide a copy of H|2|knOw and ready it for launch on a local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

Run

```
npm install

```
```
npm start

```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on a browser to view H|2|knOw.

### Additional Features Coming Soon!

To make this application even more awesome, I would like to add an "Add A Plant" feature. Users would be able to add new plants to the schedule and continue to see their plant family grow! Additionally, I would create "Edit A Plant" and "Remove A Plant" features so users can view the most accurate information. Lastly, I am working on deploying the application with Heroku. 

### Built With
React.js & FullCalendar.io
